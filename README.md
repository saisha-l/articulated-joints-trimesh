# Articulated Joints with Trimesh

Parametric, optimization-ready articulated joints designed for 3D printing and simulation.
Built using `trimesh`, `numpy`, and `polyscope`.

## Overview

This repository contains modular implementations of common mechanical joints:

- Ball Joint
- Hinge Joint
- Saddle Joint
- Universal Joint

Each joint:
- Is fully parametric
- Exposes geometry, clearance, and motion constraints
- Is suitable for downstream optimization and articulation analysis
- Can be visualized interactively using Polyscope
